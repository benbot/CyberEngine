This readme will, one day, have usefull stuff in it. For now it is here 
to tell you that this project will be used by me in Global Game Jam 2013

Since I am writting this on a linux computer all of the resource files 
that comes with it are built for linux. When I relesae a working version 
I will add windows resources. All of the resources are cross platform so 
they can be built for windows/mac if you do it your self.

When this engine is playable I will include a little game where you are 
a cube fighting other cubes. This will be my test game... thing.
